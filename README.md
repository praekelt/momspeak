## A natural language interface to MomConnect

MomSpeak is a natural language interface to MomConnect. MomSpeak allows users to submit queries to a natural language query system via existing messaging services such as USSD/SMS, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. The system then parses the query and replies automatically with the relevant information.

Internally, MomSpeak uses Junebug to handle communication between the user and the query system, and the Wit-Ai API to parse user input and respond appropriately.
